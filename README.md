In this study, when the user clicks the "click me!" button, the counter (to the left of the button) will increment by 1.

## Does Express Basic App Study feature commentary?
Yes! I use extensive commentary (mostly in the form of my thought process) so that the new and curious can follow the logic in the program and get an idea of my reasoning behind each and every line of code.  In addition to my line-by-line commantary, I also provide a Process text file that gives a good outline of my implementation process.
